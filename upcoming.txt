Yes — you **can** add more features, but remember:

I’ll give you **optional powerful features** that will make your project stand out but **won’t overcomplicate it**.

---

# ✅ **Highly Recommended Features (Professional & Realistic)**

## **1. Appointment Time Slots (Dynamic Scheduling)**

Let doctors set:

* Maximum patients per day
* Custom time slots (e.g., 15/20/30 minutes)

This makes your app **real-world ready**.

---

🔔 When doctor approves/rejects appointment
🔔 When doctor adds prescription
🔔 When admin approves doctor registration

This dramatically improves user experience.

This will **impress interviewers**.
